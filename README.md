# Calculator
Simple calculator written in C in which you can define your own functions and pattern matching rules

## Setup guide
1. Clone repository.

2. Download and install readline. (On Ubuntu: ```sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev```)

3. In root directory, run ```./make.sh [-d]``` to compile sources.

4. If you want, add alias such as ```c="~/Calculator/bin/calculator.out $@"``` in ~/.bash_aliases (when using the bash) to run program from anywhere. Arguments can be any expression as in interactive mode, which is started when program is executed without additional arguments.

## How to use it
When starting the calculator normally, you can enter expressions and commands interactively. Passed arguments will be evaluated beforehand. You can pipe in contents which will be evaluated as if typed in, after that the calculator terminates and does not enter interactive mode.

### Syntax
* Any input which is not a command will be interpreted as an expression.
* ```ans``` can be used to reference previous result.
* Two subexpressions next to each other without an infix operator will be multiplied (e.g. ```2a``` or ```(x-1)(y+1)```).
* To define a constant, you can define a function without arguments (e.g. ```myConst() := 42```) or a pattern matching rule that only applies to a variable of a specific name (e.g. ```name_myConst -> 42```).
* When applying unary functions to a literal, you can omit parentheses (e.g. ```sin2```).
* Any line starting with ```'``` will be ignored (useful for comments in files to be loaded).
